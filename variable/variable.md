# Variable in Java Script


Variables are Containers for Storing Data

> JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

+ Automatically
+ Using var
+ Using let
+ Using const

## 1. create variable - Automatically 
In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.
### Example -1 
They are automatically declared when first used:

```js
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;

```

> [!NOTE]
> It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.


## 2. Create variable - Using var 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> + The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
> + The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
> + The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
### Example -2 
```js
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```
