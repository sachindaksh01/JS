# What is the programming language?

In simple words, a programming language is like a special set of instructions you can use to tell a computer what to do. Just like you use English to tell your friends things, programmers use these languages to tell computers how to perform tasks.

Here's an example:

Imagine you want a computer to draw a circle on the screen. In English, you might say "Draw a red circle in the middle of the screen." But a computer doesn't understand English!

A programming language like Python would let you write something like this:
```python
Python
import turtle

# Create a turtle object
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Set the turtle's color to red
t.color("red")

# Move the turtle to the center of the screen
t.penup()
t.goto(0, 0)
t.pendown()

# Draw a circle with radius 50
t.circle(50)

# Hide the turtle and keep the window open
turtle.hideturtle()
turtle.done()
```

This code tells the computer to:

1. Import a library called "turtle" that helps draw things on the screen.
2. Create a "turtle" object, which is like a little drawing tool.
3. Set the turtle's color to red.
4. Move the turtle to the center of the screen.
5. Draw a circle with a radius of 50 units.
6. Hide the turtle and keep the window open so you can see the circle.

+ There are many different programming languages, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some are easier to learn than others, just like some human languages are easier to learn. But they all have the same basic goal: to give humans a way to communicate with computers and tell them what to do.
