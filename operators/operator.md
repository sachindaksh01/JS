# Java Script Operators.

JavaScript operators are like special symbols or keywords that allow you to perform operations on variables and values. Here are some common JavaScript operators explained in simple words:

## Arithmetic Operators: These are used for basic mathematical operations.
```js

+ //adds two values together.
- //subtracts one value from another.
* // multiplies two values.
/ //divides one value by another.
% // gives the remainder of a division.
```

## Assignment Operators: These are used to assign values to variables.
```js
= // assigns a value to a variable.
+= // adds a value to a variable and assigns the result.
-= // subtracts a value from a variable and assigns the result.
*= // multiplies a variable by a value and assigns the result.
/= // divides a variable by a value and assigns the result.
```
## Comparison Operators: These are used to compare values.
```js
== // checks if two values are equal.
!= // checks if two values are not equal.
> // checks if one value is greater than another.
< // checks if one value is less than another.
>=  // checks if one value is greater than or equal to another.
<= // checks if one value is less than or equal to another.
```
## Logical Operators: These are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values.
```js
&& (AND) // returns true if both operands are true.
|| (OR) // returns true if at least one operand is true.
! (NOT) // returns the opposite Boolean value of the operand.
```

## Unary Operators: These operate on a single operand.
```js
++ // increments a variable by 1.
-- // decrements a variable by 1.
- // negates the value of an operand.
```
## Ternary Operator: This is a conditional operator with three operands.
```js
10>5 ? expr1 : expr2 // If the condition is true, it returns expr1; otherwise, it returns expr2.
```
